        <h2>Welcome to iron man site</h2>
        <p>Tony Stark is the wealthy son of industrialist and weapons manufacturer 
            Howard Stark and his wife, Maria. Tony grew up a genius with a brilliant
            mind for technology and inventions and, naturally, followed in his father’s 
            footsteps, inheriting Stark Industries upon his parents’ untimely death. 
            Tony designed many weapons of war for Stark Industries, far beyond what any
            other company was creating, while living the lifestyle of a bon vivant.
            Fate would take a dark turn for Tony Stark once he decided to consult on 
            a weapons contract overseas in enemy terrain. An improvised explosive device 
            exploded underneath Tony’s transport, and he was brought to the brink of death.
            Awakening as a prisoner of the warlord Wong-Chu, Tony made a gruesome discovery: 
            the explosion had sent a piece of shrapnel mere inches from his heart. It was only 
            the timely intervention of fellow captive and engineer Yinsen that kept the shrapnel at bay.
            While held captive, and forced to work on weapons, Tony turned his near-death experience 
            into inspiration. What if he could power an iron suit that would not only keep the shrapnel
            from killing Tony, but also help him to escape?
